# CMIP6 for CORDEX

CMIP6 GCM boundary conditions availability, performance and spread tables for different CORDEX domains.

* [AUS](CMIP6_studies_table_AUS.html)
* [EUR](CMIP6_studies_table_EUR.html)
* [MED](CMIP6_studies_table_MED.html)
* [NAM](CMIP6_studies_table_NAM.html)
* [SEA](CMIP6_studies_table_SEA.html)

The information behind the tables is collected from published sources and all background information is [publicly collected here](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/cmip6-for-cordex/tree/main/CMIP6_studies). You can contribute to this effort in several ways:

 * **Global climate modelers:** Please, [report](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/cmip6-for-cordex/blob/main/CMIP6_for_CORDEX_availability_non_ESGF.csv) whether you are willing to share 3D model-level boundary data, even if not available through the ESGF. Note that we aim for [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles) data, so the data should be at some point made available through ESGF. Current availability of boundary conditions on ESGF can be found [here](CMIP6_for_CORDEX_availability_RCM.html)
 * **Regional climate modelers:** Please, report your [CMIP6 downscaling plans](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/simulation-status), which will be incorporated into the corresponding [summary tables](https://wcrp-cordex.github.io/simulation-status). Just leave GCM-related info blank (TBD) if open to downscale any of the community-agreed GCMs.
 * **Any person** can report problems or open a discussion as GitHub issues [here](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/cmip6-for-cordex/issues). You can also contribute by providing additional GCM evaluation or future spread [CMIP6 studies](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/cmip6-for-cordex/tree/main/CMIP6_studies).

_This is an outcome of the EURO-CORDEX Task Team on the CMIP6 GCM/RCM-ESD ensemble design_
