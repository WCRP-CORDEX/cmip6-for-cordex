      This is a 90% (very likely) range for the TCR according to AR6 Technical
      Summary: Based on  process understanding, warming over the instrumental
      record, and emergent constraints, the best estimate of TCR is 1.8 degC,
      the likely range is 1.4 to 2.2 degC and the very likely range is 1.2 to
      2.4 DegC. There is a high level of agreement among the different lines of

      models lying outside the observationally-constrained 90% interval obtained
      by the method are considered as implausible. The 90% interval is [1.5 ;
      2.1]degC for the period 2041-2060 vs 1850-1900, SSP245. Multi-member
      ensemble mean is used in this study for every model. Note that this
      criteria is very strict and can potentially eliminate a large number of
      GCMs.

    comment:
      Domain is CORDEX-EUR. Data z500 is converted to daily anomalies and
      normalized by daily standard deviation. Data are then attributed to
      previously obtained Synoptic Circulation (SP) classes. Number of Synoptic
      Circulation classes is 43 (derived on daily ERA-Interim data, 1979-2018).
      For each model, 7 variables are computed from the attributed daily data.
      1) HIST - frequency of each SP-class (year through) 2) HIST_JFD -
      frequency of each SP-class (winter) 3) HIST_MAM - frequency of each SP-
      class (spring) 4) HIST_JJA - frequency of each SP-class (summer) 5)
      HIST_SON - frequency of each SP-class (autumn) 6) SEQUENCE - matrix of
      frequencies for the subsequent occurrence               of the pair of two
      synoptic patterns SPi?SPj. 7) PERSISTENCE - matrix of frequency for
      persistence of each                  SP-class for 1,2,3,.. N days in a
      row.   The SCQS is computed as the mean of 7 individual Quality Scores

      Criteria to determine the plausible GCMs to drive coupled RCMs for the
      Med-CORDEX domain We examine the GCM quality to reproduce the near-
      atlantic ocean characteristics (ocean temperature and ocean salinity) for
      the surface layer (0-150m) entering the Mediterranean Sea at the Gibraltar
      Strait. Those variables are used as ocean lateral boundary conditions for
      the ocean component of the Med-CORDEX coupled RCMs Four criteria are

    comment:
      From Figure 5. Model family tree for all 33 CMIP6 models, similar to
      Knutti et al. (2013). Models branching further to the left are more
      dependent, and models branching further to the right are more independent.
      The analysis is based on global, horizontally resolved tasCLIM and pslCLIM
      in the period from 1980 to 2014. Labels with the same color indicate
      models with obvious dependencies, such as shared components or the same
      origin, whereas models with no clear dependencies are labeled in black.
      Using this figure 5, we have put in the same family, the GCM lines that
      merge before the dashed line, that correponds to the independence shape
      parameter. We have given family names only to families with at least 2
      members. Note that we are not using the Figure 5 color code to determine
      the family. This leads to some surprise such as  Strangely, ACCESS-CM2 is
      in the same family as UKESM and HadGEM3, but not ACCESS-ESM1-5. This was
      confirmed as ok by the Australian group. Also the two FGOALS model are not
      belonging to the same family with this criteria. TaiESM1 is not evaluated
      by Brunner et al. 2020. However it is published that TaiESM1 belongs to
      the CESM2 family (Lee et al. 2020,
      https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/3887/2020/, The development of
      TaiESM is based on CESM1.2.2, in which the ocean, sea ice, and river
      components, as well as the infrastructure of the model, remain unchanged.)

      Data extracted from ESGF using  https://github.com/jesusff/cmip6-for-
      cordex/blob/main/util/aerosol_species.py which feeds from

      Also, some pers. comm. for certain models that do not provide AOD by
      aerosol species. S. Yang for the EC-Earth consortium models.
