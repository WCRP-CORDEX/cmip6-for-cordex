      Criteria to determine the plausible GCMs to drive coupled RCMs for the Med-CORDEX domain
      We examine the GCM quality to reproduce the near-atlantic ocean characteristics (ocean temperature and ocean salinity)
      for the surface layer (0-150m) entering the Mediterranean Sea at the Gibraltar Strait.
      Those variables are used as ocean lateral boundary conditions for the ocean component of the Med-CORDEX coupled RCMs
      Four criteria are examined at the annual scale for both temperature and salinity: 
      mean bias, past trend, monthly-mean temporal variability, spatial consistency
      THE DATA WILL BE PROVIDED SOON
